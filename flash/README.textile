  Adobe Flash crashes when it's OBJECT is removed from DOM while file selection
    dialog, initiated and opened by Flash, is opened.
    
  I have managed somehow to see Google Chrome stopping any JavaScript execution
    while dialog box is opened, thus DOM was not able to get manipulated outside
    flash. But, then i updated to the most recent version and it still had that
    bug.
