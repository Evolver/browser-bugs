  Adobe Flash crashes when it's OBJECT is removed from DOM while file selection
    dialog, initiated and opened by Flash, is opened. Make sure you run test.html
    by accessing it through a domain, not by opening file locally from your
    computer, e.g. http://example.com/test.html, because otherwise flash will
    not open dialog box.

  I have managed somehow to see Google Chrome stopping any JavaScript execution
    while dialog box is opened, thus DOM was not able to get manipulated outside
    flash. But, then i updated to the most recent version and it still had that
    bug.
