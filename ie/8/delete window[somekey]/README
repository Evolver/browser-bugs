  Using delete window[prop] throws an exception with error 'Object does not support this
    property or method', where it shouldn't.
    
  Workaround:
  
  You have to dereference data you want to delete either by
    window[prop] =null
      or
    window[prop] =undefined
    
  Second variant is better, it allows to test if variable is undefined
    like this:
    
    if( window[prop] ===undefined)
    
  which works for both vars that are undefined and that have 'undefined'
    value type.
    
  This workaround does not remove actual property 'prop' of window object.
